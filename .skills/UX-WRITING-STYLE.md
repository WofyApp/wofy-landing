# UX writing style guide

## Repository-code-only boundary

Review only strings and their immediate code context inside the exact file, component, route, or source scope requested by the user. Never open a browser, visit a local or deployed URL, start a development or preview server, capture screenshots, inspect a rendered page, use a design canvas, install dependencies, or generate build artifacts. Do not modify application code during a review.

Do not inspect imported, adjacent, or related interface surfaces unless the user explicitly includes them. Cite every finding with an exact `path/to/file:line` location and quote the current string. When a conclusion depends on rendering or runtime context, describe it as a source-backed risk and mark confirmation as **Not verified**.

Apply language-appropriate UX-writing judgment. The detailed rules below originated in an English-language system; do not mechanically impose English-only grammar, punctuation, date, capitalization, or localization conventions on Spanish interface copy. Use only rules that transfer meaningfully to the language and product terminology present in the requested scope.

This skill carries a set of UX-writing style rules. When invoked, apply them based on what the user is asking for:

- **Drafting** — produce strings that follow these rules. Cite the rule by name when you make a non-obvious choice.
- **Reviewing** — check the user's draft against each applicable rule. Flag specific violations with the exact rule name and a fix. Don't flag rules they didn't violate. Don't add filler considerations.
- **Answering** — for questions about a rule, quote the relevant rule directly.

**When to include alternatives:** Only for violations where wording is subjective — error messages, CTAs, loading states, headers, callout body copy. Skip for mechanical fixes (apostrophe type, capitalization, number formatting) — one correct answer only.

**Confidence:** These are suggestions and not a replacement for real UX writing judgment. Your messaging should have a tone of "suggestions to consider" not "rules applied." Almost everything has exceptions, so your capabilities are largely directional. Don't make a user think you are capable of the gold standard.

**Chat format:**

**[Rule name]** What's wrong/issue

- **Fix:** "corrected string"
- **Alt:** "alternative" *(only if tone or context meaningfully differs)*
- **Alt:** "another option" *(omit if not genuinely distinct)*

Keep italic notes optional — only when the alt needs a use-case qualifier. Skip if context is obvious.

## Output format

Output findings as plain Markdown and include violations only; do not add filler or list rules the copy already follows. Start with the exact source scope reviewed. For each violation use:

**[Rule name]** `path/to/file:line` — “current string”

- **Issue:** What is unclear, inconsistent, or risky
- **Fix:** “corrected string”
- **Alt:** “alternative” *(only when tone or context meaningfully differs)*

End with **Not verified** only when a recommendation depends on rendering or runtime context. Never offer or create canvas annotations.

## Pull strings from the requested source scope

Read the exact file or component named by the user and collect its user-facing strings with their code context, such as navigation link, primary action, title, description, hint, or error. The applicable rules depend on the role each string has in the source markup.

Include responsive or conditional variants declared inside the requested source scope, but distinguish them by state or breakpoint. Skip commented-out, unreachable, or clearly deprecated strings unless the user asks to include them.

## Missing source scope

If the user does not identify a file, component, route, or pasted string, ask for the intended source scope. Do not choose or inspect a surface automatically.

## Grammar

### active vs passive voice

- Use active voice over passive voice whenever possible
- If a sentence uses 'by,' it's usually in passive voice
- Passive voice OK when you don't know who is responsible or want to focus on the action

**Do:**
- The designer created a new component set with 500 variants.

**Don't:**
- A new component set was created by the designer. *(Passive, vague, formal)*

### ampersands

- Avoid using ampersands; use the full word 'and' in most situations
- Ampersands acceptable in proper nouns (AT&T) and acronyms (R&B)

### apostrophes

- Always use smart (curly) quotes and apostrophes (‘ ’ “ ”), never straight ones (' ")
- Singular word ending in 's': add only an apostrophe (Chris’)
- Plural word ending in 's': add just an apostrophe (the managers’)
- Singular word not ending in 's': add apostrophe-s (Julia’s)

**Do:**
- Julia’s dollar
- Chris’ dollar
- the managers’ dollars
- “We couldn’t find it”

**Don't:**
- Julia's dollar *(Straight apostrophe — use smart/curly apostrophe (’))*
- "We couldn't find it" *(Straight quotes and apostrophe — use smart/curly versions (“ ” ’))*

### only (word placement)

- Place 'only' as close to what it modifies as possible
- Do not default to placing 'only' before the verb as in spoken English

**Do:**
- Your seat can use Figma Design only

**Don't:**
- Your seat can only use Figma Design *(Ambiguous placement)*

### pluralizing

- To make a plural noun ending in 's' possessive, add only an apostrophe, or rewrite
- For file extensions, add 's' (GIFs, PDFs, JPEGs)
- Do NOT use apostrophes for plural abbreviations

**Do:**
- Add multiple JPEGs to a file in bulk.

**Don't:**
- Add multiple JPEG's *(Apostrophe in plural abbreviation)*

### pronouns

- Avoid gendered pronouns when writing about people in general; use they/them/theirs
- If you don't know a person's preferred pronoun, use singular 'they'
- If writing about a specific person, ask and confirm their pronouns

**Do:**
- Ask your organization admin if they can add you to the instance.

## Formatting

### bolding

- Bold text to distinguish user-generated content (UGC) from strings
- Bold text to highlight critical information
- Bold UGC: people (names, emails), things (file/project/team names), places (domains), resources (plugins, widgets)
- Bold critical info: dates (billing dates, deadlines), money (charges, totals), implied costs (seats, licenses), roadblocks (low memory, expiring payment)
- Do NOT bold when there are already multiple font weights in the same area
- Do NOT default formatting to bold

### capitalization

- This style primarily uses sentence-case capitalization
- Capitalize first word of every sentence, lists, quotations
- Capitalize after a colon ONLY if it begins a complete sentence, proper noun, or branded term
- Capitalize names, proper nouns, languages, cities, countries, days, months, holidays
- Do NOT capitalize seasons (winter, autumn, fall)
- All individual strings start with a capital letter even if the feature name is lowercase
- Lowercase all body text sublabels ("Latest version," "Recent changes")

**Do:**
- Apply and adjust text properties in the Text section.
- Leave comments and @-mention others.

### date and time

- There are two ways of talking about time: relative and absolute
- Most UI copy uses relative time; version history uses absolute time
- Relative time increments: Just now, x minutes ago, x hours ago, x days ago, x months ago, x years ago
- Servers usually write out full words ('minutes,' 'hours') instead of abbreviating
- Absolute time formats: 9:19 AM (less than a day), Nov 9, 12:56 PM (day to year), Apr 2, 2021 10:54 AM (more than a year)
- Use American format: month before day (Oct 1, 2023)
- Use cardinal numbers, not ordinal (Aug 16, not Aug 16th)
- Three-letter month abbreviations, no periods (Jan, Feb, Mar) — don't write out the entire month
- AM and PM with no periods
- Leave off ':00' when something happens on the hour
- Don't use days of the week
- Abbreviate to 'mo' and 'yr' without punctuation in tight spaces
- Servers automatically apply and format time, but always double-check before shipping

**Do:**
- Just now
- 1 hour ago
- Edited 2 days ago
- 9:19 AM
- Nov 9, 12:56 PM
- Apr 2, 2021 10:54 AM

**Don't:**
- Aug 16th *(No ordinal suffixes — use Aug 16)*
- November 9 *(Use three-letter abbreviation: Nov 9)*
- Monday, Nov 9 *(Don't use days of the week)*

### emoji

- Use emojis sparingly, primarily on social posts and in some emails
- Avoid emojis in serious writing: legal documents, product pages, press releases

### headers

- Do NOT punctuate headers (unless with a question mark, exclamation point, or two complete sentences)
- Use sentence case for all headers

### lists

- Begin a list with an introductory sentence that ends in a colon
- Use sentence case
- Use bullets for lists that have no particular order
- Use numbers for ordered lists
- If all your list items are just one sentence, don't use end punctuation
- If one of your list items has more than one sentence, use end punctuation for all list items
- For lists with one or two straightforward items, try writing the list as a sentence instead
- For complex or lengthy lists, use bullets to make the information easier to read

### numbers

- Always use numerals, including for numbers under ten
- Numbers over three digits get commas (1,000; 10,000)
- Do NOT add ordinal suffixes (September 1, not September 1st)

### punctuation

- Use the serial/Oxford comma
- Use colons to introduce a quote, bulleted list, or series of steps
- Only capitalize the first word after a colon if it's a proper noun
- Use semicolons sparingly
- No spaces on either side of a dash, slash, or hyphen
- Use en dashes for ranges (1999-2000, 4-5:30 pm)
- Use em dashes for pauses/asides, clarifying information, or introducing examples ('that is,' 'namely,' 'for example') — especially when an abrupt break in thought is called for
- In compact surfaces (toasts, tooltips, banners), prefer comma splices over em dashes to join two short independent clauses — em dashes are visually heavier and more distracting in tight spaces
- Comma splices work like a 'hard comma' in UX writing — they join related clauses without requiring end punctuation or the visual weight of an em dash or semicolon
- Keep clauses short on both sides of a comma splice — if either clause is long or complex, consider restructuring instead
- Use hyphens for compound terms (view-only, in-product)
- Do NOT hyphenate actions (use 'log in' and 'set up' as two words)
- Use slashes for pricing ($12/editor/month)
- Do NOT use a slash for and/or — just use 'or'

**Do:**
- I like dogs, cats, and wearing hats.
- $12/editor/month
- File moved, open it in the new project
- Link copied, share it with your team

**Don't:**
- log-in *(Use 'log in' as two words)*
- and/or *(Just use 'or')*
- File moved — open it in the new project *(Em dash is visually heavy in a toast — use a comma splice for short related clauses)*

## Content patterns

### general writing tips

- Communicate in short paragraphs and common words
- Write using contractions for approachability
- Use exclamation marks, semicolons, and parentheses sparingly
- Write lines people can picture — be concrete, not abstract
- Preferred words: co-create, together, make, big ideas, collaborate, build, flow
- Words to avoid: dream (too lofty), creativity (too unspecific), playful (too ambiguous), supercharge (too marketing-speak), magical (too fantastical), artist (too poetic), utilize (too stiff)

**Do:**
- Less lorem ipsum, more true-to-life designs.

**Don't:**
- Less guesswork, more accurate mocks. *(Too abstract, not vivid)*

### keyboard shortcuts

- Write modifier keys left to right as on keyboard: Mac: ⌃ ⌥ ⌘; Windows: Ctrl Alt
- Mac shortcuts do NOT use + signs between keys (⌥⌘K)
- Windows shortcuts use + signs with NO spaces (Alt+Ctrl+Del)
- Detect platform and show correct shortcut dynamically when possible
- If dynamism isn't possible, include both shortcuts, Mac first
- To refer to the + sign itself (e.g., zoom in shortcut), write out the word 'and'
- In tight UI like menus, show shortcut combinations with spaces between keys rather than + signs or 'and'
- Introduce keyboard shortcuts with 'Press ⌘ or Ctrl, followed by any other keys'
- If space allows and for newer users, use a modal to explain shortcuts visually
- Shortcut keys reference: Command/⌘, Option/⌥, Control/⌃ (Mac); Ctrl, Alt, Shift (Windows)

**Do:**
- ⌥⌘K (Mac format)
- Alt+Ctrl+Del (Windows format)
- "To zoom, press ⌘ and +."

**Don't:**
- ⌘ + ⌥ + K *(Mac doesn't use + signs)*
- Alt Ctrl Del *(Windows uses + signs between keys)*
- Ctrl+Alt+K (in a Mac context) *(Show Mac shortcut format for Mac users)*
- CtrlAltK *(Windows needs + signs between keys)*
- "To zoom, press ⌘ + +." *(Write out 'and' when referring to the + key itself)*

### loading states

- Only add copy to progress bars for tasks that take considerable time
- Keep copy focused on the task or action
- Be succinct
- Keep copy in present tense — the action is currently happening
- Do NOT be cute — loading states are not the right context for delight
- Do NOT use punctuation (not even ellipses)

**Do:**
- Publishing changes
- Updating library

**Don't:**
- Loading... *(Too generic, and uses ellipsis)*
- Beep boop... *(Too cute, uses ellipsis)*
- Take a break while we load this *(Too wordy, not focused on the task)*

### localization

- Label voicey writing or tricky strings with notes about how to translate
- Design for string length changes: Japanese may be shorter but taller; German/French may increase ~50%
- Write strings with singular and plural versions of numerals for context comments
- Don't use 'one' to express a number — use the numeral for proper automated pluralization
- Place 'Learn more' links at end of sentence — mid-sentence order may flip in translation
- Don't start a sentence in the header and finish in options below it — syntax won't translate well
- UX writers annotate hard-to-translate copy for engineers (who add context comments)
- Add new terms to the glossary that may be helpful for translators

**Do:**
- "Molly and 1 other added to this file" / "Molly and 2 others added to this file"
- Email notifications (as a standalone header)
- "This is a Professional feature, so you'll need to upgrade to use it. Learn more"

**Don't:**
- Email me about... (with options below) *(Starting a sentence in the header and finishing in options doesn't translate well)*
- "Move your file out of drafts" as a mid-sentence link *(Link order may flip in other languages' syntax)*

### placeholder text

- Placeholder text lives inside text input fields and disappears when users begin typing
- Don't provide critical information (formatting or text entry guidance) since it disappears
- For search fields, consider reminding users what they can search for
- No italics or ellipses in placeholder text
- If including examples, use 'Ex:' at the beginning or 'etc.' at the end of a list
- Don't use placeholder text to say a field is optional — note it in the header with '(Optional)' instead
- Ex: 'Description (Optional)' as header, not optional info in placeholder

**Do:**
- Search all widgets
- Ex: Vicky's writing team

**Don't:**
- Search using full phrases... *(Don't use ellipses; be specific about what users can search for)*
- Names must be 10 characters long (as placeholder) *(Critical formatting info disappears — put it in subcopy instead)*

### selection states

- Desktop: 'Select' is the standard verb for choosing a tool or opting into a UI element
- Desktop: Once something is selected, use 'click' or 'double-click' for desktop/browser users
- 'double-click' is hyphenated
- Mobile: Use 'tap' instead of 'click'
- Keyboard: Use 'press' when a user needs to manually touch a key

**Do:**
- Select the crop tool for easy selection. Press ⌘ or Ctrl and C/V to copy/paste.

**Don't:**
- Click on the crop tool for easy selection. You can also press any button in the tool menu. *(Use 'select' for choosing tools, not 'click on')*

### sorting and filtering

- Be concise and clear; use fragments and drop articles if necessary
- Avoid abbreviations in filter labels (OK in menu options due to limited space)
- Use punctuation/symbols sparingly: '/' for referencing more than one option (e.g., 'Team/Organization'), '+' to indicate 'and'
- Open filters with the broadest option, then narrow down (e.g., 'All,' 'Only Figma resources,' 'Just FigJam files')
- Consider providing a clear way to remove selected filters
- Check out Menu component guidelines, since menus often have sorting and filtering

**Do:**
- All creators (broadest option first)
- Only Figma partners
- Figma+FigJam
- Free+paid

### tables

- Use headings/labels to clearly describe the type of content in each column
- Simplicity > precision: an easier-to-understand label is better than a technical one
- Be concise — write in fragments and drop articles if necessary
- Check with design partners on character limits and whether labels can wrap
- Tables often include sorting and filtering — see sorting and filtering guide
